## Visualizing Kirkpatrickâ€“Seidel's Ultimate Convex Hull Algorithm (?)

This is a visualization of the convex hull algorithm outlined in [the 1983 paper from David Kirkpatrick and Raimund Seidel](http://hdl.handle.net/1813/6417). It serves as a tool to learn how the algorithm works and is intended for anyone to view (not just CS majors).

This was done as a final project for Tufts' COMP-163: Computational Geometry (Fall 2016).

#### TO DO

- [x] Fix scaling / centering
- [ ] Add collapsable text introduction / about
- [ ] Add bounding back (instead of removing lower hull points)?
- [ ] Add steps for rest of algorithm
